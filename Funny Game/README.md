This is a Python code for a game that uses the Pygame library. Pygame is a popular library for creating 2D games in Python.
The code sets up a game window with a background, a player character (a goose), enemies and bonuses.
The player can control the goose with the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to avoid enemies and collect bonuses.
The game loop continuously updates the game state, handles events such as creating enemies and bonuses, detecting collisions and updating the screen.
The game loop runs until the player closes the game window.
